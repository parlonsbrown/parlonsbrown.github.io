We burn<br />into winter<br />The angry heater<br />sends pinprick blisters<br />up my arm<br />I hold it<br />As I once did you<br />to feel again</p>
<p>The rain sizzles at my window<br />They say there is a typhoon<br />But the soup<br />burns my tongue<br />I am filled with the coolness of your gaze<br />The empty laughs when we last met<br />You huddling in your purple jacket<br />Me sweating through my workaday shirt<br />Caressing pumpkin spice latt&eacute;s<br />Dreaming of bombay</p>
<p>I was a monsoon bird<br />In a snowstorm<br />And I thought you were too<br />Port city imports<br />Europe&rsquo;s frosted sighing cooling us slowly<br />I thought<br />I thought</p>
<p>But I lost you this winter<br />as you slipped under<br />I tried to pull you back<br />But Paris has you<br />speaking in fluted French<br />That I understand<br />but do not feel</p>
<p>I thought I belonged in your dreams<br />but we no longer have a shared language</p>
<p>I think of your parents<br />Father, creaking limbs and laughter<br />Loving dinners<br />Mother, huffing; blowing fan<br />cooling her royal neck<br />a parent is one for life<br />but no childhood is forever</p>
<p>The words of reassurance catch<br />like curses<br />in my throat<br />I loved this country with you<br />Once<br />Its auburn autumn<br />Clear lined trees<br />Pantheon, sun drenched orange<br />Tour Eiffel&rsquo;s radio crackle at midnight</p>
<p>But the bleached skins<br />Drained the colour from me<br />I did not know what then I was<br />My melancholy was terrible<br />I rushed to Gare du Nord<br />Square framed Lakshmi smiled emptily at me<br />The jasmine flowers smelt suspiciously<br />of dying love<br />And before I knew it,<br />I was at the counter<br />my words cascading<br />even in this sea of colour<br />in fucking French</p>
<p>Who am I, you ask?<br />I do not reply<br />Who are either of us, I ask<br />to think<br />we can live and love<br />in a land<br />that is trying so hard<br />to forget us?</p>
